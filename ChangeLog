2009-10-24 Grigori Rybkine
	* LCG_Settings/python/lcg_InstallArea.py: Add an option to create symlinks to
	libraries, executables, or both file types
	* LCG_Settings/cmt/requirements: Making use of the added option, incorporate
	pattern symlink_extern into both set_ext_lib_path and set_bin_path patterns
	so that "cmt br make" run in LCG_Release/cmt creates the same symbolic links as
	"cmt do python-build"

2009-10-24 Grigori Rybkine
	* LCG_Release/python/lcg_InstallArea.py: Move to LCG_Settings/python so
	that it can be used by any package in LCG_Interfaces
	* LCG_Settings/python/lcg_InstallArea.py: Add the functionality to allow
	for its use for separate packages from LCG_Interfaces no matter whether the
	packages are used within the LCGCMT project or elsewhere
	* LCG_Settings/cmt/requirements: Making use of the added functionality of
	lcg_InstallArea.py, introduce pattern symlink_extern to create symbolic links to
	external libraries and executables in InstallArea, replace
	declare_installed_libraries in set_ext_lib_path with the new pattern.
	* LCG_Release/cmt/requirements: Use lcg_InstallArea.py from the new location,
	do not run it here for for the default target (all)
	NOTE: Now "cmt br make" run in LCG_Release/cmt creates the same symbolic links as
	"cmt do python-build" except for the executables from the packages
	4suite, GCCXML, pyxml, pyqt, scons because they apply_pattern set_bin_path
	which does not apply pattern symlink_extern. This should be fixed when patterns
	set_ext_lib_path and set_bin_path are merged
	* LCG_Interfaces/cx_oracle/cmt/requirements: Add apply_pattern symlink_extern

	* LCG_Interfaces/HepPDT/cmt/requirements: replace HEPPDT with HepPDT

	* LCG_Settings/cmt/requirements: introduce a new pattern clean_path
	  this pattern is called in set_ext_lib_path instead of the 
	  path_remove statments.
	  the set_bin_path pattern does not contain any path_remove statments
          most of the interface packages call only set_lib_path so for them 
	  it works as before.
	  packages which apply set_lib_path and set_bin_path MUST 
	  apply set_lib_path before set_bin_path to clean the paths first
	  packages which only apply set_bin_path MUST apply clean_path before
	  set_bin_path to clean the paths first
	  Those changes have been made in:
	  GCCXML,scons,sqlite - apply clean_path
          HippoDraw,POOL,ROOT,SEAL,XercesC - apply set_lib_path before set_bin_path

	XercesC [new]

	o The package rx has been discarded.

	o XercesC has been added.

	o The SEAL and POOL interface packages are now located below LCG_Interfaces

	o LCG_policy is kept at the top level. The principle of this
	package is that it should not be used from interfaces packages,
	but only from internal LCG developments.
