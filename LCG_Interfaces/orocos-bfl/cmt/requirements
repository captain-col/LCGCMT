package orocos-bfl

# The orocos-bfl (The orocos.org Bayesian Filtering Library) provides a
# number of bayesian filters.  For the linear case, it provides a generic
# interface to Kalman filtering, but it also provides more "sophisticated"
# filters like an Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filters for the
# nonlinear case.  The library also provides generic interaces for
# smoothing (e.g. Forward-Backward filtering).
