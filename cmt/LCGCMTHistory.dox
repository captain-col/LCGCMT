Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Apr  1 12:02:14 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu

Bug Fixes:

* Fixes so that this will work with CMT v1r26.  The previous captainLCGCMT
failed because of the parallel makes.

* Refreeze to incorporate fixes in capt-freeze into the way the history
files are handled.

Back patch of old history:

\section cmt_standalone_v0r0p0_history Version 0.0.0

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sun Mar 31 11:45:22 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu

The very first freeze of the external packages.  This builds:

ROOT, fftw (for mathmore), gsl (for mathmore), 
GEANT, xercesc (for gdml), dawn (for G4 geometry visualization).

   - Freeze Date: Fri Jun 14 18:37:29 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu 


Add the boost library with a reduced set of the libraries compiled.

This is the major version of LCGCMT intended for producing the CAPTAIN
proposals.  It includes the major infrastructure packages (e.g. ROOT,
GEANT4) as well as their support packages (fftw, gsl, &c).  It also
includes the GENIE neutrino interaction simulation.  There are also several
other utility packages that we will need, or want to use (boost [general
utilities] , dawn [for drawing geometries], orocos [for Bayesian
filtering], &c).

The packages to compile as defined in the captainLCGCMT package, and the
versions are defined in the LCG_Configuration package.

\section LCGCMT_v1r0p1_history Version 1.0.1

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Sat Nov  9 09:25:24 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.local 


BUG FIX:

    The LHAPDFs are not being pulled correctly.  This changes to the
    LHAPATH directory when the GENIE builder tries to get it's pdfs.


\section LCGCMT_v1r0p2_history Version 1.0.2

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Nov 25 10:10:25 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu boxer.local 


BUG FIX:

** Any compilation using Boost or orocos was having a lot of warning
   messages due to unused typedef statements in the included templates.
   This freeze adds compiler options to gcc to mark these include files as
   "system includes" so that warnings are turned off.


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p0_history Version 1.1.0

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Dec  2 15:31:34 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu boxer.local 


NEW FEATURES:

** Add the CGAL library (Computational Geometry Algorithm Library) which
   provides about what it's name says.  The algorithms that are (probably)
   most interesting are the fast triangulation in 3D (i.e. tessallation),
   and 3D nearest neighbor finding.


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p1_history Version 1.1.1

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Wed Dec  4 14:43:16 2013
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu boxer.local 


BUG FIX:

    Fix the linkopts and use statements in CGAL, gmp and mpfr so that it's
    easier to link user code.  


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p2_history Version 1.1.2

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Fri Jan 17 10:16:03 2014
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu 


BUG FIX

** Fix the mpfr builder which needs gmp but didn't have the correct use
   statement in the requirements file.


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p3_history Version 1.1.3

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Fri Jan 17 15:06:26 2014
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu 


BUG FIX

Make sure that boost builds even when it appears to have already been
unpacked. 


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p4_history Version 1.1.4

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Apr  7 16:12:16 2014
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.physics.sunysb.edu boxer.local 


BUG FIXES

* Fix boost compilation so that the compiler and variant is not in the
  library name.  This fixes a problem where BOOST infers a different
  compiler name than LCGCMT.  

* Make sure that the BOOST library path is before the boost library
  linking.

* Fix the pkg_get.py script to catch makedirs exceptions.  This fixes a
  problem on macs.

NEW FEATURES

* Upgrade the ROOT version 5.34.18.

* Add cmt macros to control skipping the installation of LCGCMT packages.
  This lets us avoid trying to compile packages that will not work on
  mac maverick. 


\section LCGCMT_v1r1p5_history Version 1.1.5

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Mon Apr 14 17:03:35 2014
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.local 


BUG FIX:

** Adapt to SL5: This has been debugged on the PDSF.NERSC.GOV cluster, but
   should work on any SL5 cluster.  


\section LCGCMT_v1r2p0_history Version 1.2.0

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Fri Oct 10 17:34:40 2014
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer.local boxer.local 


New Feature:

The sqlite data base has been added as an option to be compiled with ROOT.
I think we are going to have very minimal database needs, and will not need
a full mysql server.

Bug Fix:

Packages are more uniformly unpacked into the binary destination
directory.  This means that different configurations will have completely
different files and the configuration status should not be contaminated.


\section LCGCMT_v1r2p1_history Version 1.2.1

Freeze information:
   - Freeze Date: Thu Jan 15 17:50:16 2015
   - Freeze User: mcgrew
   - Freeze Host: boxer 


This patch is compatible with 1.2.0

New minor features:

* Add build tags in captainLCGCMT to allow LCGCMT to be built with out the
  support for MC generation.

* Prevent unpacking boost source if the boost source already exists in the
  build directory.
