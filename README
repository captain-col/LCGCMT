LCGCMT downloaded from lcgsoft.cern.ch and imported from a tar file.

The LCGCMT tar files contain a the project with a release directory,
(LCGCMT/<release>/...), so they should be imported by striping the first
two directory components.  The command to import LCGCMT_64d was

capt-import-tar-file --dry-run --tag=LCGCMT_64d --strip-components=2 \
            xvzf ../../tar/LCGCMT_64d.tar.gz

The imported version was then tagged "upstream-LCGCMT_64d" on the upstream
branch.  The imported version can then be merged with the master branch
