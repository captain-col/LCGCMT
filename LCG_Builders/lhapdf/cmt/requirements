# ****************************************************************
# IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PDF SETS
# 
# After 5.7.0, LHAPDF no longer bundles PDF set data in the package
# tarball.  The sets are instead all stored online at
#   http://www.hepforge.org/archive/lhapdf/pdfsets/
# and you should install those that you wish to use into
#   .../EXTERNALS/lhapdf/6.0.2/i686-linux-gcc47-opt/share/LHAPDF
# 
# In LHAPDFv6, downloadable sets are packaged as tarballs, which
# must be expanded to be used. Here is an example of how to
# retrieve and install a PDF set from the command line:
# 
#  wget \
#    http://www.hepforge.org/archive/lhapdf/pdfsets/6.0/CT10nlo.tar.gz -O- | \
#    tar xz -C .../EXTERNALS/lhapdf/6.0.2/i686-linux-gcc47-opt/share/LHAPDF
